# fccTimestampApi
<h2>FreeCodeCamp's First API Challenge</h2>
<p>User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</p>

<p>User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</p>

<p>User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</p>
